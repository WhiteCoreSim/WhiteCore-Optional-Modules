* tree configure <advanced> - Interactive configuration of a copse of trees
                 <advanced> - true  - enter initial size, maximum size and growth rate
				              false - use defaults for initial size, maximum size and growth rate 



Configuration
=============

The Tree generator module is disabled from loading by default and needs to be enabled in the 'Nature.ini' 
  configuration file. (Found in Config/Sim/Modules)
 
[Trees]
    ;; Enable this to include access to the TreeGenerator module
    ;; default is false
    enabled = true
....


TIP:  the 'active_trees' setting
If you set 'active_trees = true' in the ini file, trees will commence growing immediately. This 'may' cause WhiteCore startup problems depending upon your configuration.
If you are happy with your configuration you can try enabling this if you wish to have a region with a growth pattern that emulates and essentially will become, a "Living Region" with the tree Life Cycle going on.

Adding Trees
------------

To load a predefined copse of trees from an existing definition file and start them growing...

# change region RegionName   -  where RegionName is the region you wish to populate 
                               (the trees command will not operate unless you have changed to a region)
# tree load OakGrove.copse   - Place the OakGrove.copse definition file in 'bin' OR another path where you have saved it.
                               Adjust the path to the '.copse' file accordingly i.e.: c:\trees\OakGrove.copse 
# tree active true           - true = Enable growing of trees, false = Disable growing of trees
# tree plant OakGrove        - This is the copse name as defined in your copse file.
                               NOTE: The spelling IS CASE SENSITIVE 

If you wish to define your trees interavtively, use the command...
# tree configure             - The configurator will guide you through selection and placement of your trees.
          

Removing Trees
--------------
# tree freeze OakGrove 		 - Freeze the current growth of the 'OakGrove' copse
# tree remove OakGrove       - Removes the trees in the 'OakGrive copse and removes it's definition
                               (Rememeber, the Copse Name is Case Sensitive)
# tree active false          - Deactivates the Tree Module



Using Multiple Copse Definitions
================================

You an use Multiple Definitions and load as many as you like. 
(good & useful in the case scenario as discussed below, otherwise avoid doing so)
You may grow more than one Copse at a time however this may lead to a bit of confusion.
It would be handy if you had an inworld scripted device which used osConsole Commands to issue commands
 to the tree module for changing Tree Copses and processing a more organic environment.

Deactivate when you are done and see your Handy Work. It is pretty cool to watch it while the trees grow, 
but it may take some time to start as there is a LifeCycle in play but action sppeds up as they mature and seed out, 
it's a lots of fun to watch.

Special Note:
The Tree Module is an "Environmental" module and therefore has no knowledge of Buildings or Structures on your land
 and it will automatically plant on Land Surface (above or below waterline). If you have structures, they will get 
 Trees inside which you will have to clean out.


Sample Known Good Working copse Files
=====================================
Sample files of all avilable trees and plants are in the Examples folder (where this file is) 
* NOTE: These are set to cover an entire region from centre out, 125m in any direction.
   See the <m_range>125</m_range> setting

--- Values Described Below Adjust to Suit Your Needs ---
m_name          - string specifying a name by which the copse will be known
m_frozen        - current freeze state, generally set false on an initial load
m_tree_type     - the tree that will comprise the copse. Valid tree types are shown below.
m_tree_quantity - the number of trees to be grown and maintained in a copse
m_treeline_low  - minimum ground height for planting this copse
m_treeline_high - maximum ground height for planting this copse
m_seed_point    - the X & Y region co-ordinates of the first tree to be planted. Z MUST BE 0 "ZERO" or it will fail!
m_range         - the maximum distance from the seed point that a tree will be planted 
                   (this is also affected by the type of plant)
m_initial_scale - the X, Y and Z object scaling factors for a seeded tree
m_maximum_scale - the X, Y and Z object scaling factors for a mature (full grown) tree
m_rate          - the growth factor on each iteration

TREE TYPES:
Cypress1, Cypress2, Pine1, Oak, TropicalBush1, Palm1, Dogwood, TropicalBush2, Palm2, Pine2, Plumeria, WinterPine1, WinterAspen, 
WinterPine2, Eucalyptus, Fern, Eelgrass, SeaSword, Kelp1, BeachGrass1, Kelp2. 
Note that some are appropriate for underwater planting.

NOTES:  A few things to remember
================================

* The z value for the seed point is not ignored, but MUST be set to zero. If it is non-zero, you get just one tree 
  that grows to maturity and then stops. That's it.

* The tree module was designed to be used on empty land prior to building on. It cannot & does not know where buildings
  and objects are on a region. Therefore it rezzes trees and starts the growth cycle according to the specs provided 
  in the XML files related to the particular tree.

* depending on the initial size of the plant, the next seeds will be seeded at a distance proportional to its size. 
  It means if you intend to grow very young plants (very small) that should become big ones, there is an issue with
  the seeding distance at the beginning. I tried for instance to use 0.05 , 0.05, 0.05, for 25 plant (plumerias) and 
  with a range of 100m , just to see the plants grow ... they seeded in a very tiny space. 

Unverified comments at this time
================================
- I tried forests of 2000, 1000 ,500 Pines. I wanted to keep a kind of house in the middle .. of course trees 
  invaded my tiny construction ... and i had to remove them manually . but .. it seems in some cases the seeds avoid 
  to occupy territories as much as they can .. Not all the time and i'm not sure of it but it seemed to me to do so .. 
  
  ??As a suggestion, maybe it could be possible to put a texture on the ground and the seeds would avoid those places ??... haha ..

- when using different Copses on a region, when you switch the "tree active" command to true/false/true
  (not sure of the number of times) , i noticed underwater plants, which previously behaved accordingly to my parameters
  of high and low lines, began to grow on the hills above water. I noticed that behaviour while i was working on a "land"
  copse, reswitching the tree active to true. Coming back after a while , I was surprised to find seaswords on the top of 
  a quite desertic mountain .. So as a workaround , i think it's better to work step by step (Copse by Copse) and switch 
  the "Freeze Copse true" command once a copse is finished. ...
